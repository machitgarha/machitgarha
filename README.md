A back-end developer. Not enough. An open source developer, also, or at least trying to be. Yes, the title may shout at you that I want my bucket being empty. No, it is lying. Look at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) and [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/). Even without them, there is a huge hidden opportunity in open source.

I do care a lot about performance. Resources are important. Oh, let me clarify, micro-optimizations are mostly evils. And when I see a tiny Python program is exploding my CPU, then I explode the program itself. It's not a rant. Come here to see how I win over Python in an everyday-happening action game here.

Never ever forget privacy. Our data is important a lot. If you think it is just non-sense, so please read the quotes in [privacytools.io](https://privacytools.io/), especially the first one. This is one of the reasons why I'm on GNU/Linux.

Last but not least, I'm proudly an Iranian and a Muslim. After all, the life is not just programming, and we should not only be in the code-eat-sleep-repeat cycle.

## Favorites (Technological)

-   **Programming Languages:** PHP. I love it. C++ also.

-   **Operating System:** Fedora Workstation (GNU/Linux). Super stable.

-   **Desktop Environment:** Gnome (Wayland). KDE is also looking good.

-   **Licenses:** GNU licenses are just great for FOSS community. Apache License 2.0 is also a good choice.

-   **People:** Linus Torvalds, Dennis Ritchie and Richard Stallman. Thank you all.

## Things I Avoid

-   **Windows (10):** I don't want to say aloud to Microsoft what is being done on my system. Yes, privacy matters. Updating is a mess there. PowerShell or even WSL2 is not comparable to Bash. Sometimes even I prefer Gnome UX against Windows's. And let's face the facts: I've addicted to my system, and there is little thing I cannot do here (if any).

-   **Python:** I try not to hate it, because I don't know much about it. The problem is not its syntax, or the language itself. Sorry to say, but its performance sucks. My personal experience tells me that, without looking at benchmarks. For instance, for the first run, I have to wait for DNF to respond a single output for a while.

-   **Ubuntu:** Not that unusable, but it is unstable. A clever guy should discover why almost every Ubuntu-based distribution is great, but not Ubuntu itself. I really hope it be a stable and performant distribution.
