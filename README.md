A back-end developer. Not enough. An open source developer, also, or at least trying to be. Yes, the title may shout at you that I want my bucket being empty. No, it is lying. Look at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) and [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/). Even without them, there is a huge hidden opportunity in open source.

I do care a lot about performance. Resources are important. For instance, it's really sad that such a great language as Python has such a super-slow interpreter. Yes, PyPy is a thing, but can you use it system-wide?

Never ever forget privacy. Our data is important a lot. If you think it is just non-sense, so please read the quotes in [privacytools.io](https://privacytools.io/), especially the first one. This is one of the reasons why I'm on GNU/Linux.

Last but not least, I'm proudly an Iranian and a Muslim. After all, the life is not just programming, and we should not only be in the code-eat-sleep-repeat cycle.

## Favorites (Technological)

-   **Programming Languages:** PHP. I love it. C++ also.

-   **Operating System:** Fedora Workstation (GNU/Linux). Super stable.

-   **Desktop Environment:** Gnome (Wayland). KDE is also looking good.

-   **Licenses:** GNU licenses are just great for FOSS community. Apache License 2.0 is also a good choice.

-   **People:** Linus Torvalds, Dennis Ritchie and Richard Stallman. Thank you all.

## Things I Avoid

-   **Windows (10):** I don't want to say aloud to Microsoft what is being done on my system. Yes, privacy matters. Updating is a mess there. PowerShell or even WSL2 is not comparable to Bash. Sometimes even I prefer Gnome UX against Windows's. And let's face the facts: I've addicted to my system, and there is little thing I cannot do here (if any).

-   **CPython Interpreter:** A performance and CPU killer. My personal experience tells me that, without looking at benchmarks. For instance, for the first run, I have to wait for DNF to respond a single output for a while (now look at C++-written APT).

-   **Ubuntu:** Not that unusable, but it is unstable. A clever guy should discover why almost every Ubuntu-based distribution is great, but not Ubuntu itself. I really hope it be a stable and performant distribution.
