A developer trying to shift his focus to open-source. The title may shout at you: "I want my bucket being empty". No, it is lying. Look at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) and [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/). Even without them, there is a huge hidden opportunity in open source.

In my ideal world, all of science and all technologies are open. By keeping things closed, most likely it is you (being a person or a group) that matter the most. In an open environment, however, you think further: Advancing the world as a whole is much more important.

Privacy is another benefit you get by using free software. It really matters, trust me. If you think it is just non-sense, go on and read [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/jm16vx/why_is_securityprivacy_important_to_you/). This is one of the reasons why I'm on GNU/Linux, particularly Fedora.

Last but not least, I'm proudly an Iranian and a Muslim.

## Favorites (Technological)

-   **Programming Languages:** PHP. I love it. C++ also.

-   **Operating System:** Fedora Workstation (GNU/Linux). Super stable.

-   **Desktop Environment:** Gnome (Wayland). KDE is also looking good.

-   **Licenses:** GNU licenses are just great for FOSS community. Apache License 2.0 is also a good choice.

## Things I Refuse to Work With

-   **Windows (10):** I don't want to say aloud to Microsoft what is being done on my system. Yes, privacy matters. Updating is a mess there. PowerShell or even WSL2 is not comparable to Bash. Sometimes even I prefer Gnome UX against Windows's. And let's face the facts: I've addicted to my system, and there is little thing I cannot do here (if any).

-   **Ubuntu:** Not that unusable, but it is unstable. A clever guy should discover why almost every Ubuntu-based distribution is great, but not Ubuntu itself. I really hope it be a stable and performant distribution.
