A developer trying to shift his focus to open-source. The title may shout at you: "I want my bucket being empty". No, it is lying. Look at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) and [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/). Even without them, there is a huge hidden opportunity in open source.

In my ideal world, all of science and all technologies are open. By keeping things closed, most likely it is you (being a person or a group) that matter the most. In an open environment, however, you think further: Advancing the world as a whole is much more important.

Privacy is another benefit you get by using free software. It really matters, trust me. If you think it is just non-sense, go on and read [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/jm16vx/why_is_securityprivacy_important_to_you/). This is one of the reasons why I'm on GNU/Linux, particularly Fedora.

Last but not least, I'm proudly an Iranian and a Muslim.

## Favorites and Daily Tools

### Technological

Git and GNU/Linux (specifically its terminal) are the tools I cannot live without. Thanks, Linus Torvalds.

Always following news in the PHP world (mostly from [this subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/php)). Whenever I want to write something new, I prefer to use PHP for that, especially if it's a console application. However, sometimes the libraries in Python are making the life easier, so I use Python for those cases.

The Linux distro I use is Fedora Workstation. Enjoying the bleeding-edge while having an stable system: I've never felt I need to reinstall it or switch to another distro (since more than two years ago).

I love all the *GPL licenses, and use them as much as possible.

Other things I like: C++, OOP with traits and interfaces.

### Other Stuff

I love Islamic philosophy (thanks to the books of Morteza Motahhari and Allameh Tabatabaei).

## Things I Refuse to Work With

-   **Windows:** I don't want to say aloud to Microsoft what is being done on my system. Yes, privacy matters. Updating is a mess there. PowerShell or even WSL2 is not comparable to Bash. Sometimes even I prefer Gnome UX against Windows's. And let's face the facts: I've addicted to my system, and there is little thing I cannot do here (if any).

-   **Ubuntu:** Not that unusable, but it was really unstable in my experience. I had problems with AppArmor that the system didn't even boot, for example.

-   **NVIDIA:** Not a new trend among Linux users. If you're not aware, just search the web.
